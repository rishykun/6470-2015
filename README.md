Schrodinger's Black Box is a unique concept that connects users around the world (potentially) through box-sharing. Each user can create or receive a box, through which they can upload their own files (text, audio, video) to share a piece of their own culture. Users are not limited by how they share information, leading to endless possibilities. Boxes have a capacity limit on the number of files, and contributors can only view each box once it has reached that capacity. When complete, collaborators are notified through email and can then view the contents of the box, allowing them to see what other contributors have put.
This idea presents a whole new outside-of-the-box approach to the familiar theme "around the world", a viable solution to this "issue" that most people would not have though of.
While many people would propose ideas such as local music finding apps or geographical mapping devices to this theme, our team believes that "around the world" can be interpreted much more loosely and focus on the concept of sharing information and cultural exchange.
