[VERY IMPORTANT]
- instead of console.error, we need to return a fail message to the front end so that the server doesn't crash unnecessarily whenever any error occurs (FIX VERY FRAIL SERVER)
- REMOVE ALL CONSOLE LOGS
- can't upload shit from my phone
- REMOVE CHENG WANG FROM GALLERY
- sanitize forms

would like to do future features
