[VERY IMPORTANT]
- instead of console.error, we need to return a fail message to the front end so that the server doesn't crash unnecessarily whenever any error occurs (FIX VERY FRAIL SERVER)
- REMOVE ALL CONSOLE LOGS
- can't upload shit from my phone
- REMOVE CHENG WANG FROM GALLERY

would like to do future features
- delete boxes
- message system/ contact users

SETUPUSER CONTROLLER
closing modal should redirect to help if this is the first time
	or settings if this isnt the first time

PROFILE CONTROLLER
have profile specially mark complete boxes to distinguish them from incomplete boxes
display "you have no boxes" if there are no boxes created and no collaborated

minor issues/css
fix the scrollbar for upload modal
make css of profile pretty
