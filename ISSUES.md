[VERY IMPORTANT]
- instead of console.error, we need to return a fail message to the front end so that the server doesn't crash unnecessarily whenever any error occurs (FIX VERY FRAIL SERVER)

[IMPORTANT]
- OPTIMIZE THE SPEED OF OUR WEBSITE
LOADING THE HOME PAGE TAKES MUCH LONGER THAN IT SHOULD (TOO MUCH OVERHEAD)
- can't upload from phone

would like to do future features
- delete boxes
- message system/ contact users
- remember me
