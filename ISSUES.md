issues:
- what happens if u log in at the same time from multiple locations
- why is login slow for windows

- why profile gets called 6 times
why is Created and Collaborated populateed 6 times (appended) instead of resetting and adding

todo:
- add user field for signup/signin [UNRESOLVED]
- receive
- upload changing state and going back doesn't work
- refactor:
	put main controller's resize in its own controller/factory/whatever
	move box config and stuff like that out of main controller and into a service (maybe box or boxlist)
- initial resize of sign modal doesn't work
- remember me
- overwriting users & folders and in general in aws s3 server
	prevent overwrite
- reserve certain words (to prevent overwrite of necessary initial items)
