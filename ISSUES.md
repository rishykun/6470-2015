- why is login slow for windows

- why profile gets called 6 times
why is Created and Collaborated populateed 6 times (appended) instead of resetting and adding

- add user field for signup/signin [UNRESOLVED]
- receive
- upload changing state and going back doesn't work
- put create in its own state
- initial resize of sign modal doesn't work
- remember me
- overwriting users & folders and in general in aws s3 server
